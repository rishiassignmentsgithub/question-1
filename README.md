1. First issue has been fixed by showing the size of the array of objects(orders).

2. I have addressed the second issue by merging the data according to the ids of the orders.

3. For this issue I have passed current in the props and manipulated the later components accordingly.

4. Implement the search functionaly by filtering out the merged array by order IDs.

5. All consoles and warnings have been addressed.

6. Populated the cards by passing and receiving the desired data.

## Bonus

I have added the component named Dropdown into the story book also.
